My Experience using LaTeX to write a research paper on software architecture.

<!-- truncate -->

## TLDR

For my University of Calgary software architecture course, I wrote a research paper on software architecture. I used LaTeX to write the paper and found it to be a great experience. I highly recommend using LaTeX for writing research papers, because it handles almost all the formatting for you. It is also great at automatically updating if you have a massive formatting changes. I used [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) to write the paper, which is a great online LaTeX editor.
