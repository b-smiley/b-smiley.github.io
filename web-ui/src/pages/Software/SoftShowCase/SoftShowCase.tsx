            description="Built a desktop application that acquires voltage data from a filtering device 
            using Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). The application was created using LabVIEW. 
            The application had a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allowed the
             user to select device settings (which were configurable through register writes) and then start data acquisition.
            The application would export the data to a csv file.
            This was a interesting application to build because I was tasked with the entire project; from writing 1's and 0's into registers, all the way up to a GUI. 
            I had to be mindful of proper abstraction and encapsulation to ensure that the project was maintainable and scalable. 
            Additionally, I had to learn SPI communication on the fly so it was quite rewarding to problem solve a real world application I didn't understand, 
            with my foundational university knowledge. 
            What can be seen in the GIFs an oscilloscope probing the SPI lines.
            The first GIF shows a slower sampling rate while the second GIF shows a faster sampling rate. The blue line is the serial clock signal, the green line is the data out signal, and the
            red line is the data ready (DRDY) signal. 
            The DRDY signal is used to tell the microcontroller that the data is ready to be read.
             DRDY is a crucial signal to ensure that the data is being read in time before the next sample, and is not a garbage value. The SPI communication protocol 
            is a fascinating topic and I will be posting a blog post about it in the future so look out for that!

            description="For a object orientated programming course, I was tasked with creating a disaster relief system. The system had to be able to add, remove, and search for victims and their related information. 
          Some of the related information was a victim's medical records, location, and family members. 
          The business logic was created with Java, and JUnit was used for testing. Learning about unit testing was a game changer for me, finding edge cases in a automated test helps remove potential bugs in the future. The course required the creation of UML diagrams as well which taught me how to properly design a system before coding. 
          The UML diagram provided wasn't the final implementation but it provides a good idea of how the system was designed. Feel free to zoom in or click on the diagram to see it in more detail."

            Additionally, an EERD diagram and relational schema diagram  were created to model the database. 
            The museum application had a login system that would allow users to have different permissions. For example, a guest could only view the database 
            while a data entry user could add, edit, and delete from the database. There was also a admin user that could add, edit, and delete users. Depending on the user privileges, the system would display different options on the side panel.
            As seen in the GIF, having a 'canned transactions lookup' page was one of the features that a guest or data entry user could use to view the database. 
            These canned transactions required correct SQL query. If the canned transaction had multiple checkboxes selected (Ex. Artist and Art Objects) the query would have to avoid a cartesian cross product, as the result intuitively should only return art objects related artists."

            This game was made in 2022 and I still like to showcase it to show how much I have improved since then. It was my first attempt at building something from scratch. Overall, I learnt more about Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and how to use library documentations. The game uses the WASD keys to move and the mouse click to shoot in the direction of the gun. The user can reload by pressing R. I did the art myself using Procreate (Which is why it looks so bad ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜¬). Additionally, the music and sound effects were made in garage band. The hardest part of the project (at the time) was developing the music class as I wanted to be able to play music while hearing the gun sound affects. This prooved to be difficult at first to run them both at the same time."
