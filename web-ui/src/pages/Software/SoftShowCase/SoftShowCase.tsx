            description="A database management system for an art museum. The system was created using MySQL as the database, Python (EEL) as a backend, and HTML, CSS, Javascript as a frontend.
            Additionally, an EERD diagram and relational schema diagram  were created to model the database. 
            The muesum application had a login system that would allow users to have different permissions. For example, a guest could only view the database 
            while a data entry user could add, edit, and delete from the database. There was also a admin user that could add, edit, and delete users. Depending on the user privileges, the system would display different options on the side panel.
            As seen in the GIF, having a 'canned transactions lookup' page was one of the features that a guest or data entry user could use to view the database. 
            These canned transactions required correct SQL querys. If the canned transaction had multiple checkboxes selected (Ex. Artist and Art Objects) the query would have to avoid a cartesian cross product, as the result intuitively should only return art objects related artists."

            This game was made in 2022 and I still like to showcase it to show how much I have improved since then. It was my first attempt at building something from scratch. Overall, I learnt more about Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and how to use library documentations. The game uses the WASD keys to move and the mouse click to shoot in the direction of the gun. The user can reload by pressing R. I did the art myself using Procreate (Which is why it looks so bad ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜¬). Additionally, the music and sound effects were made in garage band. The hardest part of the project (at the time) was developing the music class as I wanted to be able to play music while hearing the gun sound affects. This prooved to be difficult at first to run them both at the same time."
